Monorepo that contains all pieces of a Micro-Front-End (MFE) app: host app and remote (aka federated) apps. Each remote app can be managed independently from other remotes: it can be stored in its own source repository and developed independently from other remotes.

Plain JavaScript implemtation is used to demonstrate module federation in the simplest way possible. For React and Angular micro-frontend implementations see my other GitHub repositories.

Components:
  * Host app:
      * host

  * Remote apps: 
      * Header
      * Navigation
      * Footer
      * Button
