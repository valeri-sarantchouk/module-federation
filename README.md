Top level shell (host) project that assembles remote apps into a single UI using Webpack Module Federation.

The monorepo contains all remote apps mfe-header, mfe-nav, mfe-button. 

All applications (host and remotes) are implemented as plain JavaScript modules in order to demonstate module federation in the simplest way possible.

Examples of federated apps written in React, Angular and Svelte implementations, see my other repositories.

Remote apps: 
  * Header
  * Navigation
  * Footer
  * Button
