Top level host (shell) application project that assembles remote apps into a single app using Webpack Module Federation.

Plain JavaScript implemtation is used to demonstrate module federation in the simplest way possible.

For React and Angular micro-frontend implementations see my other GitHub repositories.

Remote apps: 
  * Header
  * Navigation
  * Footer
  * Button
